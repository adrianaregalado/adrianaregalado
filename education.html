								<h3>2016 - Boston University</h3>
								
								<p>I attended the summer program, <a href="https://www.bu.edu/summer/high-school-programs/honors/"> High School Honors</a>, at Boston University during the summer of 2016. High School Honors is a 6 week program that gives high school upperclassmen the opportunity to take a couple college classes at a world-renowned university alongside college students. They offer a variety of class subjects, including Introduction to Human Diseases and Introduction to Management, both of which I took. This experience was really eye opening for me, as I realized exactly what being a college student entails in a more personal and direct manner. The college professors that I encountered there were unlike any of my previous high school teachers in the sense that professors give their students a lot more responsibility and independence, and I was able to improve on my time management skills and I learned how to better balance my academic, social, and personal life. This experience taught me more than I ever could have imagined, and because of it, I was better equipped to start of my first semester of college at the Ohio State University.</p>

								<h3>2017 - The Ohio State University</h3>
								<p>As a young 18 year old, I was ecstatic to start my first semester at one of the largest universities in the nation. The possibilities were limitless and there were options for every kind of student, no matter what major you are or where you come from, and I immediately felt welcomed by everyone I met.</p>

								<p>I entered my freshmen year as a Neuroscience major, but I soon realized that I was not completely immersed in the classes I was taking and I was feeling unsatisfied. I switched majors to Undecided, and this is when I really began to panic. I took an Exploration class that would allow me to get a taste of many different majors that Ohio State has to offer. One of the classes I took that semester was Introduction to Programming in Java, and after spending only a few weeks in that class, I realized this was something I would love to study.</p>

								<p>I immediately switched my majors and was so dedicated to Computer Science that I began to do research on top Computer Science colleges. I was determined to learn as much as I could and receive the best education possible to pursue my computer science career. I was accepted into the University of Wisconsin - Madison and made the decision to transfer shorty after.</p>

								<h3>2019 - University of Wisconsin-Madison</h3>
